# reactive-db

**reactive-db** is an in memory documents oriented reactive NoSQL database with MongoDB syntax (not full support). No external software needed !

What all these words means :

* **database** : you can store data
* **in memory** : your datas are stored in the host memory. So, it is neither meant to store huge amount of data, nor indexed data.
* **document oriented** : your data don't have to be flatten to a table. You just store any object in collections.
* **NoSQL** : No SQL syntax is used to query the BDD
* **MongoDB syntax** : Use MongoDB query syntax to create, read, update and remove data inside your collections of data. (aggregation not supported)
* **reactive** : You can subscribe/unsubscribe to any collection, so if documents are created, updated, or removed, you'll be notified.

## Limitations

**reactive-db** is not performance optimised. It's goal is to provide an easy way to store and query with a notification mecanism. It may be slow with lots of datas stored. However, you can store any amout of data as long as there's enough free memory in the host system.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add reactive-db
```

or

```bash
npm install reactive-db
```

## Usage

### Class: `ReactiveDatabase`

A database contains many collections. They are instanciated with `new ReactiveDatabase()`.

```javascript
const ReactiveDatabase = require('reactive-db')
const db = new ReactiveDatabase()
```

#### `db.connect()`

* Returns: `Promise`

Only for compatibility with MongoDB API. `db.connect()` just return a resolved `Promise`.

#### `db.showCollections()`

* Returns: `String[]`

Get every known collections name.

#### `db.getCollection(collectionName)`

* Arguments
	* `collectionName` (`String`) : Name of the collection to get.
* Returns: `ReactiveCollection`

The first time `db.getCollection(collectionName)` is called, the collection named `collectionName` will be created and returned. The other times, the collection will just be returned.

```javascript
const collection = db.getCollection('superheroes')
```

### Class: `ReactiveCollection`

A `ReactiveCollection` is where documents are stored. Documents are JS objects. Each modification inside a collection can be notified.

#### `collection.subscribe(watcher, callback)`

* Arguments:
	* `watcher` (`Any`): The instance that will watch for updates.
	* `callback` (`Function`): the callback which will be called if something happens.
* Returns: `undefined`

When one or many documents of the collection is created, updated or removed `callback` will be called with `watcher` as its `this`.

**NOTE:** A collection can have many watchers. A watcher can subscribe to many collection. A watcher can subscribe only once to a collection (only the latest subscription will be retain).

```javascript
collection.subscribe(this, changes => {
  console.log(`${changes.length} documents have been created, updated or removed.`)

  changes.forEach(change => {
    console.log(`[${change.collection}] The document _id "${change._id}" is marked with operation type "${change.operationType}".`) // [superheroes] The document _id "1" is marked with operation type "insert".
    if (change.fullDocument !== undefined) {
      // fullDocument only for "insert" or "update" operationType.
      console.log(`New content: ${change.fullDocument}`)
    }
  })
})
```

#### `collection.unsubscribe(watcher)`

* Arguments:
	* `watcher` (`Any`): The instance that is watching for updates.
* Returns: `undefined`

Remove `watcher` fore the collections watchers.

```javascript
collection.unsubscribe(this)
```

#### `collection.count()`

* Returns: `Promise`

Returns a promise that resolves to the number of documents inside the collection.

```javascript
const documentsCount = await collection.count()
console.log("There are", documentsCount, "inside this collection")
```

#### `collection.insert(data)`

* Arguments:
	* `data` (`Object` or `Object[]`): The document(s) to insert
* Returns: `Promise`

Insert one or many documents in the collection. Once done, the promise is resolve. Use the same syntax as `collection.insertOne()` or `collection.insertMany()`.

#### `collection.insertOne(data)`

* Arguments:
	* `data` (`Object`): The document to insert
* Returns: `Promise`

Insert one document in the collection. Once done, the promise is resolve.

```javascript
collection.insertOne({
  firstname: 'Peter',
  lastname: 'PARKER',
  age: 25,
  hasSuperPower: true
})
```

#### `collection.insertMany(data)`

* Arguments:
	* `data` (`Object[]`): The documents to insert
* Returns: `Promise`

Insert many documents in the collection. Once done, the promise is resolve.

```javascript
collection.insertMany([
    {
      firstname: 'Tony',
      lastname: 'STARK',
      hasSuperPower: false
    },
    {
      firstname: 'Bruce',
      lastname: 'BANNER',
      hasSuperPower: true
    }
  ])
```

#### `collection.find([query, [projection, [options]]])`

* Arguments:
	* `query` (`Object`): Optional. Specifies selection filter using query operator. If not provided, default is `{}`.
	* `projection` (`Object`): Optional. Specifies the fields to return in the documents that match the query filter. To return all fields in the matching documents, omit this parameter.
	* `options` (`Object`): Optional. Used to sort, limit or skip data.
* Returns: `Promise`

Find all documents matching a query.

```javascript
// find all documents
collection.find()

// find all documents for Tony STARK
collection.find({ firstname: 'Tony', lastname: 'STARK' })

// find all firstnames, in descending order. Results limited to 2nd - 11th
collection.find({}, { _id: 0, firstname}, { sort: { firstname: -1 }, limit: 10, skip: 1 })
```

#### `collection.findOne([query, [projection, [options]]])`

* Arguments:
	* `query` (`Object`): Optional. Specifies selection filter using query operator. If not provided, default is `{}`.
	* `projection` (`Object`): Optional. Specifies the fields to return in the documents that match the query filter. To return all fields in the matching documents, omit this parameter.
	* `options` (`Object`): Optional. Used to sort, limit or skip data.
* Returns: `Promise`

Same as `collection.find()` but the promise resolve to the first document matching the `query` with the specified `projection` and `options`.

#### `collection.update(query, update, [options])`

* Arguments:
	* `query` (`Object`): Specifies selection filter using query operator.
	* `update` (`Object`): Specifies the modifications to apply. Can be a document or a set of of update operators. See [modifyjs](https://github.com/lgandecki/modifyjs) for more infos.
	* `options` (`Object`): Optional. `limit`, `sort`, `skip` will be applied to search documents. If the `upsert` option is used, create the document if no match is found.
* Returns: `Promise`

Find all documents matching a query and modify their content. 

```javascript
// Modify all documents containing {hasSuperPower: true}, to add a property "isLuckyGuy" set to "true"
collection.update({
    hasSuperPower: false
  }, {
    $set: {
      isLuckyGuy: true
    }
  })

// If no Bruce BANNER, create a document containing :
// { firstname: 'Bruce', lastname: 'BANNER', hasSuperPower: true }
collection.update({
    firstname: 'Bruce',
    lastname: 'BANNER',
  }, {
    hasSuperPower: true
  }, {
    upsert: true
  })
```

#### `collection.updateMany(query, update, [options])`

Same as `collection.update()`

#### `collection.updateOne(query, update, [options])`

Same as `collection.update()` but only the first matching document will be updated.

#### `collection.remove(query, [options])`

* Arguments:
	* `query` (`Object`): Specifies selection filter using query operator.
	* `options` (`Object`): Optional. Use `{justOne: true}` to remove just one document.
* Returns: `Promise`

Remove each documents matching `query`.

#### `Promise.prototype.toArray()`

For compatibility with MongoDB API, this library add a `toArray()` method to the `Promise` prototype. It just return the current `Promise`

```javascript
collection.find().toArray()
// is equivalent to
collection.find()
```
### Query operators

`reactive-db` support some of MongoDB query operators, incluing :


* `$eq`: Matches values that are equal to a specified value.
* `$gt`: Matches values that are greater than a specified value.
* `$gte`: Matches values that are greater than or equal to a specified value.
* `$in`: Matches any of the values specified in an array.
* `$lt`: Matches values that are less than a specified value.
* `$lte`: Matches values that are less than or equal to a specified value.
* `$ne`: Matches all values that are not equal to a specified value.
* `$nin`: Matches none of the values specified in an array.
* `$exists`: Matches documents that have the specified field.
